Prove that a sequence of functions $(f_n)$ defined on $A\subseteq\mathbb{R}$ converges uniformly on $A\iff\forall \epsilon>0$ there exists an $N\in\mathbb{N}$ such that $|f_{n}(x)-f_{m}(x)|<\epsilon$ $\forall m,n\ge N$ and all $x\in A$.

**proof:** 

$\implies$: suppose that $(f_{n})$ converges uniformly on $A$. Then, given $\epsilon>0$, $\exists N\in\mathbb{N}$ such that $|f_{n}(x)-f(x)|<\frac{\epsilon}{2}$ $\forall x\in A$, $n\ge N$. It follows that if $m,n\ge N$, then
$$|f_{m}(x)-f_{n}(x)|\le|f_{m}(x)-f(x)|+|f(x)-f_{n}(x)|<\epsilon$$

$\Longleftarrow$: suppose that $\forall \epsilon>0$ there exists an $N\in\mathbb{N}$ such that $|f_{n}(x)-f_{m}(x)|<\epsilon$ $\forall m,n\ge N$ and all $x\in A$. We wish to show that $(f_n)$ converges, and its convergence is uniform. Notice that for every $x\in A$, the sequence $(f_{n}(x))$ is a Cauchy sequence in the real numbers (by our assumption), and hence it converges by a theorem proven in class. Next, choose some $\epsilon>0$. We have by assumption that $\exists N\in\mathbb{N}$ such that $|f_{n}(x)-f_{m}(x)|<\frac{\epsilon}{2}$ $\forall m,n\ge N$ and all $x\in A$.  Consider $|f_{n}(x)-f(x)|$. We can find for each such $n$ and $x$ some $m\ge N$ such that
$$|f_{n}(x)-f(x)|=|f_{n}(x)-f_{m}(x)+f_{m}(x)-f(x)|\le|f_{n}(x)-f_{m}(x)|+|f_{m}(x)-f(x)|$$
by the triangle inequality. 
Since we have shown that $f_{m}(x)$ converges to $f(x)$ in the real numbers, we can find some $m\ge M$, not depending on $x$, such that $|f_{m}(x)-f(x)|<\frac{\epsilon}{2}$. Thus, we have $|f_{n}(x)-f(x)|<\epsilon$, for all $x\in A$ and $n\ge\max\{N,M\}$, and therefore $(f_n)$ converges uniformly to $f$ on $A$.
