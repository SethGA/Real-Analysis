Let $f(x)$ be uniformly continuous on $\mathbb{R}$ and define a sequence of functions by $f_{n}(x)=f(x+ \frac{1}{n})$. Show that (a) $(f_{n}(x))$ converges uniformly to $f(x)$, and (b) give an example to illustrate that convergence is not uniform if $f(x)$ is only continuous but not uniformly continuous.

(**a**): We want to show that $\forall \epsilon>0$, $\exists N\in\mathbb{N}$ such that $n\ge N$ implies that $|f_{n}(x)-f(x)|<\epsilon$ $\forall x\in A$. Since $f(x)$ is uniformly continuous on $\mathbb{R}$, $\forall \epsilon>0$, $\exists \delta>0$ such that $\forall x,y\in\mathbb{R}$, if $|x-y|<\delta$, then $|f(x)-f(y)|<\epsilon$. Consider the sequence $f_{n}(x)=f(x+ \frac{1}{n})$. For $n> \frac{1}{\delta}$, we have $|\frac{1}{n}|<\delta$, such that $|x+ \frac{1}{n}-x|=| \frac{1}{n}|<\delta$. Hence, $|f_n(x)-f(x)|<\epsilon$ $\forall x\in\mathbb{R}$. Therefore, $f_{n}(x)$ converges uniformly to $f(x)$.

(**b**): Consider $f(x)=\frac{1}{x}$. This function is continuous but not uniformly continuous: we can find such a $\delta$ for every $x$ and $\epsilon$, however if we fix $\epsilon$, the values for $\delta$ we need become arbitrarily small as $x$ approaches $0$. A sequence of functions $(f_n)$ converges uniformly to a function $f$ on an interval $A$ if for every $\varepsilon > 0$, there exists an $N\in\mathbb{N}$ such that $|f_n(x) - f(x)| < \epsilon$ for all $x\in A$ and for all $n\ge N$. Assume for the sake of contradiction that $f_{n}(x)$ converges uniformly to $f(x)$. Then $|f_{n}(x)-f(x)|=|\frac{1}{nx^{2}+x}|<\epsilon$. As $x$ approaches $0$, the magnitude of $|\frac{1}{nx^{2}+x}|$ increases without bound, regardless of how large $n$ we choose, implying that there doesn't exist an $N$ satisfying our requirement for uniform convergence; a contradiction.
