Define the sequence of functions $(f_{n}(x))$ on $\mathbb{R}$ by:$$f_{n}(x)=x\text{ if }x=1,\frac{1}{2},\dots, \frac{1}{n}\hspace{1cm}0\text{ otherwise}$$
Let $f(x)$ be the pointwise limit of this sequence.

(**a**) is each $f_{n}(x)$ continuous at $0$?

Each function $f_{n}(x)$ is indeed continuous at $0$. Essentially, $f_n$ is zero everywhere except at finitely many points, which include $1, \frac{1}{2},\dots, \frac{1}{n}$. Considering any $\epsilon>0$ we can find a $\delta>0$ (such as $\frac{1}{n+1}$) such that whenever $|x-0|<\delta$, we have $|f_{n}(x)-0|<\epsilon$. Thus, by definition, each $f_{n}$ is continuous at $0$.

(**b**) is $f(x)$ continuous at $0$?

The limit function $f$ is the zero function (since for every $x\ne1, \frac{1}{2}, \frac{1}{3},\dots$, the sequence $f_{n}(x)$ is constantly zero), which is continuous everywhere, including at $0$.

(**c**) does $f_{n}(x)$ converge uniformly to $f(x)$?

The sequence $(f_n)$ does not converge uniformly to $f$. This can be seen by taking $\epsilon=\frac{1}{2}$. No matter how how large you choose $N$, there will always be some $n>N$ and $x= \frac{1}{n}$ such that $|f_{n}(x)-f(x)|=| \frac{1}{n}-0|= \frac{1}{n}>\epsilon$ when $n>2$. Thus, the definition of uniform convergence is not satisfied.
