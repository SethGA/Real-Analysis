Let $f:[0,1]\to\mathbb{R}$ be a continuous function. Show that $f$ cannot obtain each value in its image $I=\{f(x)|x\in[0,1]\}$ exactly twice.

**proof:**

$f$ is continuous, so $\forall c\in[0,1]$, $\forall \epsilon>0$ $\exists \delta> 0$ such that if $x\in B_{\delta}(c)$ then $f(x)\in B_{\epsilon}(f(c))$.
Assume for contradiction that $f$ obtains each value in its image exactly twice. So $\exists a,b\in[0,1]$ such that $f(a)=f(b)\in\mathbb{R}$. Without loss of generality, assume that $a< b$, then the interval $(a,b)$ is nonempty. 
We apply the Intermediate Value Theorem in the interval $[a,b]$, because $f$ is continuous in $[a,b]$, and any value between $f(a)$ and $f(b)$ will be attained at some point in the interval $(a,b)$. But, since $f(a)=f(b)$, any value in between must be $f(a)=f(b)$. Herein we reach a contradiction, as it stands to reason that $f(x)=f(a)=f(b)$ for some $a< x< b$. Consequently, $f$ obtains a value in its image more than twice.
