$A\subseteq\mathbb{R}^{d}$. $V$ is the union of all open subsets of $A$. $V$ is open. If $U$ is an open subset of $A$ then $U\subseteq V$ such that $V$ is the largest open subset of $A$. Prove that $\text{int}A=V$.

**proof**: showing equality directly

$\subseteq$: Let $x$ be an arbitrary point in $\text{int}A$. By definition of interior, there exists an open set $U$ such that $x\in U$ and $U\subseteq A$. Since $V$ is the union of all such open sets including $U$, we have $U\subseteq V$. Hence, $x\in U\subseteq V\subseteq A$. Since $x\in V$, it follows that $\text{int}A\subseteq V$.

$\supseteq$: Let $x\in V$. Since $V$ is open, $\exists$ $r>0$ such that $B_{r}(x)\subseteq V$. Since $V$ is the union of open sets, $B_{r}(x)$ is one of those sets and hence $B_{r}(x)\subseteq A$. Thus, any point $x\in V$ has an open ball $B_{r}(x)$ contained entirely within $A$, making $x$ an interior point of $A$. Therefore, $V\subseteq\text{int}A$.

Therefore, since $\text{int}A\subseteq V$ and $\text{int}A\supseteq V$, $\text{int}A=V$.$$Q.E.D.$$
