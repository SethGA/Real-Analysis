Let $A\subseteq\mathbb{R}^d$. Prove that $A$ is closed $\iff\bar A=A$.

> This proof is circular, has yet to be updated.

**proof**:

$\implies$: Let $A$ be closed. As shown in class, a closed set contains all its cluster points, such that $A'\subseteq A$. Hence, $A\cup A'=A$. Therefore, $\bar A=A\cup A'=A$.

$\Longleftarrow$: Let $\bar A=A$. Since $\bar A$ is closed, and $A=\bar A$, then $A$ is closed.
