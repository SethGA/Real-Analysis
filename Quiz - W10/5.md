Suppose $f$ is continuous on some interval $I=[a,b]\subseteq\mathbb{R}$ and that $f(a)< 0$ and $f(b)> 0$. Use the least upper bound property of $\mathbb{R}$ to prove that $f(c)=0$ for some $c\in(a,b)$.

**proof:**

$I=[a,b]$ is compact since it is closed and bounded by $a$ and $b$. We define $S\subseteq I:S=\{x\in[a,b]|f(x)\le 0\}$. $S$ is the image of $I$ under $f$, and as such by the Extreme Value Theorem is compact as well.

We wish to show that $\sup S$ exists. Let us propose $s=\sup S$. Since it is the least upper bound, $\forall \epsilon> 0$ $\exists x\in S$ with $s-\epsilon< x$. Picking $\epsilon_{n}=\frac{1}{n}$ and $x_{n}$ such that $s-\epsilon_{n}< x_{n}$, we get $(x_{n})\to_{n\to\infty}s$ since $(\epsilon_{n})\to_{n\to\infty}0$, thus $s\in S$.

If $c=\sup S$, then by our definition of $S$, $f(c)\le 0$. Given $f(a)< 0$ and $f(b)> 0$, assume $f$ is nondecreasing, then since $c=\sup S$, $f(c)=\sup f(S)$ and so $f(c)=0$.
