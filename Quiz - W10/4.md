**proof:**

$\implies$: Suppose $f$ is continuous. Then $\forall c\in X$, $\forall \epsilon>0$, $\exists \delta>0$ such that $x\in B_\delta(c)$ $\implies f(x)\in B_\epsilon(f(c))$. Let $c\in X$ be arbitrary, then $f(c)\in Y$ is arbitrary and there is some $f(c)\in O$. Since $B_{\epsilon}(f(c))\subseteq O$, let $f(x)\in B_{\epsilon}(f(c))$. It follows that $\exists r>0$ such that $B_{r}(f(x))\subseteq O$. Since $c$ arbitrary, there are arbitrary $x\in B_{\epsilon}(f(c))$ for which this holds. Hence $O$ must be open.

Since any arbitrary $f(c)\in O$ has a corresponding $c\in f^{-1}(O)$, then all $f(x)\in O$ also have corresponding $x\in f^{-1}(O)$. Then $B_{\delta}(c)\subseteq X$ and all $x\in B_{\delta}(c)$, so $\exists a>0$ such that $B_{a}(x)\subseteq X$. Since they all have an $f(x)$ and $f(c)$, both $B_{\delta}(c)\subseteq f^{-1}(O)$ and $B_{a}(x)\subseteq f^{-1}(O)$. Hence $f^{-1}(O)$ is open.

$\Longleftarrow$: Suppose that $O$ and $f^{-1}(O)$ are open. We want to show that $\forall c\in X$, $\forall \epsilon>0$, $\exists \delta>0$ such that $x\in B_\delta(c)$ $\implies f(x)\in B_\epsilon(f(c))$. By definition, $\forall c\in f^{-1}(O)$, $\exists \delta>0$ such that $B_{\delta}(c)\subseteq f^{-1}(O)$. Since $c$ corresponds to $f(c)$, $\exists \epsilon>0$ such that $B_{\epsilon}(f(c))\subseteq O$. Lastly, $f^{-1}(O)\subseteq X$ and $O\subseteq Y$, so $\forall c\in X$, $\forall \epsilon>0$, $\exists \delta>0$ such that $x\in B_\delta(c)$ $\implies f(x)\in B_\epsilon(f(c))$.
