For the following, prove that either (a) the set is compact or (b) that it is not compact by finding a counterexample that violates the definition of sequential compactness.

1. $\mathbb{N}$. The natural numbers are *not* compact since they are not bounded: the sequence $(n)$ for any $n\in\mathbb{N}$ diverges, which violates the definition of sequential compactness.
2. $(\mathbb{Q}\cap[0,1])\subseteq\mathbb{R}$. Not compact: counterexample is $\frac{1}{3}( 1+ \frac{1}{n})^{n}$ which converges to $\frac{1}{3}e$
3. The Cantor set. $C$ is clearly bounded since it is defined within the interval of $[0,1]$. As proven in question (1), $C$ is perfect, so $C=\bar C$, and hence $C$ is closed (by a previous quiz problem). Therefore, since $C$ is bounded and closed, it is compact.
