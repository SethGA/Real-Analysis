A set is *perfect* if $A=\bar A$ and it contains no isolated points. Prove that the Cantor set $C\subseteq \mathbb{R}$ is perfect.

**proof:**

*The Cantor set is its closure*. Recall that $C=\bigcap\limits_{n=0}^{\infty}C_{n}$, and $C_{0}=[0,1]$, $C_{1}=[0,\frac{1}{3}]\cup[\frac{2}{3},1],\dots$ . Since any $C_{n}$ is the union of closed intervals, the intersection of infinitely many such $C_n$ is closed, as seen in class. By a previous quiz problem, since $C$ is closed, $C=\bar C$.

*The Cantor set contains no isolated points*. Suppose that $x\in C$. We wish to show that $\hat B_{r}(x)\cap C\ne\emptyset$ $\forall r>0$. We have that $x\in C=\bigcap\limits_{n=0}^{\infty}C_{n}$. Clearly, the Cantor set breaks into branches, so WLOG assume $x$ is in the leftmost branch. Then for $C_1$, $x\in[0,1]$, for $C_2$, $x\in[0,\frac{1}{3}]$, for $C_{3}$, $x\in[0,\frac{1}{9}]$, for $C_{n}$, $x\in[0,\frac{1}{3n}]$. Let $\epsilon>0$, then by the Archimedean property $\exists \epsilon:\epsilon<\frac{1}{3n}$ $\forall n\in\mathbb{N}$. Hence $\epsilon$ is in all $C_n$, including the leftmost branch. We conclude that $\epsilon\in\hat B_{r}(x)\cap C$, such that $\hat B_{r}(x)\cap C\ne\emptyset$, and therefore all $x\in C$ are cluster points.

Since $C=\bar C$ and $C$ contains no isolated points, $C$ is perfect.
